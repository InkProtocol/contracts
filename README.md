#### Decentralized reputation and payments for peer-to-peer marketplaces.

:bookmark_tabs: [Read the Whitepaper](https://paywithink.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ink_Protocol_Whitepaper_V6_Listia_Inc.pdf)

Ink Protocol is implemented on Ethereum as a Smart Contract and includes an ERC20-compatible utility token, called `XNK`, which is used for payments. `XNK` is a general purpose cryptocurrency that is:

- Fixed supply (`500,000,000 XNK`)
- Fractionally divisible
- Non-inflationary
- Fungible and transferable

##### Smart Contract features

Ink Protocol solves some of the most common and difficult issues with buying and selling on a P2P marketplace through the following features:

- Decentralized feedback
- Decentralized reputation
- Decentralized escrow with third party dispute resolution
- [Mediation](https://github.com/InkProtocol/contracts/wiki/Mediation) and Transaction Fees
- [Linked Addresses](https://github.com/InkProtocol/contracts/wiki/Linked-Addresses)
- [Owners](https://github.com/InkProtocol/contracts/wiki/Owners)

## Ethereum Main Network
