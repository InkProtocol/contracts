Ink Protocol is implemented on Ethereum as a Smart Contract and includes an ERC20 compatible utility token, called `XNK`, which is used for payments. `XNK` is a general purpose cryptocurrency that is:

- Fixed supply (500,000,000 `XNK`)
- Fractionally divisible
- Non-inflationary
- Fungible and transferable, likely via third party exchanges

##### Smart Contract features

Ink Protocol solves some of the most common and difficult issues with buying and selling on a P2P marketplace through the following features:

- Decentralized feedback
- Decentralized reputation
- Decentralized escrow with third party dispute resolution
- Mediation and Transaction Fees
- Linked Addresses
- Authorized Agents

## Ethereum Main Network
